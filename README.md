# DeFi Lending & Borrowing Platform

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

This smart contract represents a simplified DeFi lending and borrowing platform, enabling users to deposit collateral, request loans, repay loans, and retrieve their collateral. The contract ensures that loans are over-collateralized to maintain a low-risk ecosystem.
